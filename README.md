# Phone-Book-Application
Data Structure and algorithms Group Project

Phone Book Project Description:
In our Data Structures and Algorithms course, we developed a Phone Book project that allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage contact information. The project emphasizes the use of data structures and algorithms to optimize performance and enhance user experience.

Why We Chose Merge Sort
Stable Sorting: Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. In the context of a phone book, this is crucial when sorting contacts by name while preserving their original order when names are identical.
Efficiency with Large Data Sets: Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it highly efficient for sorting large datasets. Given that phone books can grow significantly over time, this efficiency ensures that our application remains responsive even as the number of contacts increases.

Additional Points
User-Friendly Interface: Our project features an intuitive interface that allows users to easily add, search, and delete contacts. This focus on usability ensures that even those with minimal technical knowledge can navigate the phone book effortlessly.
Advanced Search Functionality: We implemented advanced search capabilities, allowing users to find contacts not only by name but also by other criteria (e.g., phone number or email). This functionality greatly enhances the usability of the phone book.
Real-World Applications: The project demonstrates practical applications of data structures and algorithms in everyday life. By simulating a real-world phone book, we highlight how efficient data management can benefit users in managing their contacts effectively.
